# Quiz-WebApp-Vue.js

ü§ì Fact: I'm learning Vue.js. This app will be growing while my knowledge in Vue grows. My next challenge is to integrate Typescript. 

üìù Quiz WebApp displays a maximum of 20 'general knowledge' questions and gives the user multiple choice answers.

üî® It's being built using Vue.js, Bootstrap-vue and an external API. 

üéô The readme will be updated as the app grows and I start to implement new features.
